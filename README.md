# Budget-App

In this project I have built nicely structured budget app which is useful to keep track of your monthly budget. The app is build using JavaScript modular approach. Here you can add as many incomes or expenses as you want in their separate column and the total of it also displayed on the top of the page. You can even delete particular field at any time and according to that the result will gets updated automatically. App also calculate and display each individual expense's percentage and the total expense percentage based on the income value.
